# General
Readme is a comand line interface tool that converts PDF to Audio. It makes use of Python and Google to read the PDF.
Right now there is only a female voice available. However most of the languages are supported. There are sometimes little 
mistakes when parsing the PDF but all in all it still works really consistent.

# Installation
**Windows:**
Readme comes as a Python script so you will need Python to run it. It can be installed from <a href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>.
Also make sure to install the Python Package Manager pip which will normaly be an option included in the Python installer.
Clone the Repository and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Linux/Mac:**
Python is in most cases already pre-installed. Make sure you have pip installed by opening a command prompt and type 
```
pip -V
```
which will print the installed pip version. If this throws an error you will need to install it.
Clone the Repository and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Navigate to the Repository Folder and open a command prompt. Then run the **main.py** with the parameters you want.

**Example:**
```
python main.py -i inputfile.pdf -l de -o outputfile.mp3
